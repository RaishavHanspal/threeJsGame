Two game modes available, you can either play or just watch the match between the characters.
You can choose your player amongst the unlocked players. Each tournament ends with a reward of unlocking a character and ranking up.
In Settings, you can customize your gameplay with options like graphics as Medium, High, or Ultra; Difficulty as Normal, Hard, Harder, or Expert; and Sound on a scale of 100.
The health of each player increases with each win and is not affected if the player loses. On Leveling (Ranking) up, the players and opponents will also have more health accordingly.
In Fight mode, there is a virtual joystick to move the character forward, backward, and jumping up; and three buttons with the respective attacks.
